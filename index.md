## Academics

I am majoring in English and Computer Science. I am currently enrolled in **ENGL396: Software Documentation**. When I graduate, 
I plan to become a technical writer or a data scientist.

## Hobbies

When I am not studying, I like to play soccer, read science fiction, and play the piano.

These are my favorite soccer teams:

- Seattle Sounders SC
- Liverpool FC
- FC Barcelona

I also love making things with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

## Programming Background

I am relatively new to programming. The following table summarizes my experience with different programming languages:

| Language | Experience |
|---------:|------------|
| Python   | Minimal    |
|  HTML    | Authored many web pages    |
|  SQL     | Can write complex joins       |


## Words of Wisdom

One of my favorite quotes is from Albert Einstein:

> "The only thing that you absolutely have to know, is the location of the library."
